# Nodes

Spook implements various Phantasma standard features in a single easy to use tool. These tools can be leveraged from the SDK allowing developers to setup a full Integrated Development Environment(IDE) locally.

For development of Phantasma applications it is recommended you run a Phantasma node locally. It acts as your own personal blockchain network.

To view the code, read the instructions and deploy your own instance of Spook, head over to [Github](https://github.com/phantasma-io/Spook).
