# Phantom Force

Phantom Force is Phantasma's decentralized community of developers and core contributors who wish to contribute and build the best user experience & ecosystem on Phantasma Chain and within the Phantasma dApps.

Funded by 1/3rd of Phantasma's 3% annual inflation, Phantom Force developers can submit dApp concepts and other proposals for peer review and receive sustainable funding to boost their efforts. All developers are free to reach out to current Phantom Force members if they wish to join the community.

The Phantom Force functions as a [DAO](https://blockchainhub.net/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/).
