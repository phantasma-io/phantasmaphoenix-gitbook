# Token Deployment UI

The Token Deployment UI is a web interface for creating Carbon tokens and NFTs without writing code. It builds Carbon transactions and asks your wallet to sign them.

## What you can do

- Deploy fungible tokens and NFTs
- Create NFT series
- Mint NFTs
- Infuse NFTs (attach assets to an NFT address)

## How it works

1. Open the Token Deployment UI: https://deploy.phantasma.info
2. Connect a wallet that supports Carbon transactions.
3. Choose an action: Deploy, Series, Mint, or Infuse.
4. Fill in the required fields (token details and metadata).
5. Review and sign the transaction in your wallet.
