## Phantasma Phoenix Blockchain

Phantasma Phoenix is eco & user friendly  blockchain  for content distribution of Smart Digital Assets that is fast, secure and decentralized.

With its innovative staking mechanism, dual token system, sustainable tokenomics model and advanced eco-friendly smartNFTs. The chain is designed to be used for digital goods & services for communications, entertainment, marketplaces and on-chain storage solutions for dApp creators and enterprise clients.

Phantasma has low minting and transaction fees because of its smartNFT technology that has been built on chain level and its pledge to become the first certified carbon negative blockchain.

SmartNFTs are NFTs with dynamic properties that can change based on certain conditions. They provide game developers the opportunity to make dynamic in-game items decentralized, which is not possible with traditional NFTs. They also allow for time-based NFTs, multi-layered NFTs, infused NFTs and locked content within an NFT that can only be accessed by the owner of the NFT. The NFTs can be minted on-demand at a fraction of the costs compared to other blockchains.

Phantasma has an easy-to-use connector between dApps, wallets and blockchain via Phantasma Link.
