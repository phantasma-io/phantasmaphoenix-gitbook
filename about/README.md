## Phantasma Phoenix Blockchain

Phantasma Phoenix is a decentralized, feature-rich Layer-1 blockchain, enhanced by the Phantasma Phoenix upgrade, which delivers improved performance, scalability, and developer experience. Implemented in C# and C++, Phantasma is the blockchain of choice for game developers and real-time applications, offering streamlined tools for creating and managing fungible and non-fungible tokens without smart-contract complexity. Its asset layer is built around Carbon at the core, which is a native asset runtime where tokens and NFTs are created, stored, and transferred directly by the chain without deploying custom smart contracts. SmartNFTs then extend that foundation with smart-contract-driven logic that lets NFTs evolve and update their content based on defined rules.

With its innovative staking mechanism, dual-token system (SOUL and KCAL), sustainable tokenomics, and Carbon and SmartNFT technologies, Phantasma provides an eco-friendly and highly efficient framework for digital goods and services, gaming, entertainment, marketplaces, communications, and on-chain storage solutions for both dApp creators and enterprise clients.

Live on mainnet since October 2019, Phantasma is a fast-growing infrastructure platform for gaming and NFTs, built to compete for leading positions as adoption accelerates, while combining low minting and transaction fees with advanced NFT functionality built directly at the protocol level. It is also the first certified carbon-negative blockchain.

Phantasma has an easy-to-use connector between dApps, wallets and blockchain via Phantasma Link.
