# Our Features

## Carbon native assets

Carbon is the native asset runtime for tokens and NFTs on Phantasma Phoenix. Asset operations (create, mint, transfer, burn) are built into the chain, so standard token and NFT flows do not require custom smart contracts or VM execution. Metadata is schema-validated by the chain. See the full overview: [Carbon: Native Assets on Phantasma Phoenix](/about/carbon.md).

## SmartNFTs (dynamic NFTs)

SmartNFTs extend Carbon with smart-contract-driven logic for NFTs that can evolve and update their content based on defined rules. A Carbon NFT can be upgraded to a SmartNFT by embedding a TOMB (PhantasmaVM) contract in its Carbon metadata.

## NFT addresses and infusion

Each NFT has its own Carbon address derived from its token id and instance id. Assets sent to that address become attached to the NFT, enabling nested ownership. Infusion is supported by both Carbon NFTs and SmartNFTs.

## Dual Token Economy

_Govern with SOUL - Fuel your experience with KCAL_

SOUL and KCAL work together in the Phantasma economy.

**SOUL**

- Core token used for staking and governance.
- Staking SOUL mints KCAL.

**KCAL**

- Fuel token used for transaction fees and on-chain operations.

## Carbon-negative footprint

Phantasma is the first certified carbon-negative blockchain.

## Wallet connectivity

Phantasma Link connects dApps to wallets for signing transactions and interacting with the chain.

## Tools and SDKs

Use the Token Deployment UI for Carbon workflows: [Token Deployment UI](/about/token-deployment-ui.md). Developers can also build directly with the TypeScript, C#, and Unity SDKs in the developer section.

## On-chain storage

Phantasma includes a native storage contract for on-chain data.
