# Library Importing

To Import a library you first need to choose one from the list

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Example

In this **example,** we will be importing the **NFT** library, but it could have been any of the other libraries in the list.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
contract test {
	import NFT;
	
	public sum(a:number, b:number):number
	{
		return a + b;
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Yeah it's that easy.
{% endhint %}
