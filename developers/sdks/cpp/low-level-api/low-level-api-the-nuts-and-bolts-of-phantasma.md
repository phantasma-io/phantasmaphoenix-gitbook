# Low-Level API: The Nuts and Bolts of Phantasma



Welcome to the Low-Level API section of the Phantasma C++ SDK documentation. Here, we dive into the core mechanics of the API, providing you with the knowledge and tools to interact with the Phantasma blockchain at a fundamental level. Perfect for those who love to know exactly what's happening under the hood!

### Understanding the Low-Level API

The Low-Level API is the bedrock of the Phantasma C++ SDK. It deals directly with constructing JSON requests and handling JSON responses. This section is for developers who prefer to have complete control over their blockchain interactions.

#### Key Features

* **Direct Blockchain Communication**: Interact directly with the blockchain using finely-tuned JSON requests.
* **Granular Control**: Manage every aspect of your request and response formats.
* **Detailed Insights**: Gain in-depth understanding of how the blockchain responds to various queries.

### Getting Started with Low-Level API

1. **JSON Requests**: Learn how to craft JSON requests tailored to your specific needs. Understand the structure and necessary components of a valid Phantasma blockchain request.
2. **Parsing JSON Responses**: Once you send a request, the blockchain will respond in JSON. We'll show you how to parse and interpret these responses effectively.
